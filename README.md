# License
Stanford CoreNLP is under the GNU GPL license which makes this whole repository GPL I think. A quote from their homepage:  
"Note that the license is the full GPL, which allows many free uses, but not its use in proprietary software which is distributed to others. For distributors of proprietary software, CoreNLP is also available from Stanford under a commercial licensing".
